    <title>Jickr - the Flickr API</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <P>A library of Flickr objects.  The goal of this library is to completely hide the
  complexity of the Flickr REST API, exposing Java Objects that behave in a natural,
  obvious manner.</P>
  
  <P>This package is not thread safe.  The user must protect the objects if they are accessed
  by multiple threads.  The package will be made thread safe in a future version.</P>
  
  <P>Please note that since many of the methods on these objects, including object
  creation, can make backend calls to the Flickr REST API, they may take a rather large
  amount of time.  The user may wish to run them as background threads if possible (i.e., in
  a Swing app).  Some caching is done, and more will be implemented as time allows.</P>
